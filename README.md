Computer Science Repository for various projects.



This is for Dr. Mason's Class. (Computer Science 1)

Projects here are in order (01, Strings & Data Types, 02, The way of the Function, 03, Iteration, 04, Selection etc.)

Euclid already has some basic creations in it, you may look at the documentation.

Extra information:
  - Euclid is a drawing pygame framework.
  - Classwork is misc stuff that happens in class.
  - Test Runs are for the auto-grader which you can find the code for at the bottom of every project.

Timestamps / Updates can be found on the commit logs. Most of my code is not easily read by other people.

  Do not steal code. Study it.
