Intro:
Hey guys, today we wanted to share some of our knowlege as cheaters of CS:GO.
Our group has a combined experiance of over 10 years, and we think that we can share some of our knowlege as the bad guys.
If you guys are just here to dislike the video, you'll find that we dont ruin the game for normal players if you watch the entire video,.
So that being said, please make sure to watch the entire video, before making the decision to dislike and comment something negative.

Section 1:

[Screen] The differance between overwatch bans, and VAC bans.

[Voice] There is a huge misconception in the modern day community about the differant ways Valve hands out bans.
valve anti-cheat, better known as VAC is the valve's in-built anti cheat system. We will get into more detail of why VAC doesnt work.
Overwatch is the community's anti cheat. This is based off of trusted accounts being able to review demos or recordings of games that 
have suspected cheaters.
A VAC ban on somebody's profile means they were banned the by the in-built anticheat system.
A gameban on record, means the person or suspect was banned by overwatch.

[Screen] Why VAC is the worst anticheat. (No really, its the worst.)

[Voice] Valve anti cheat works in a way that no other anticheat does. VAC is a non-intrusive anti-cheat that does not scan any running 
programs. It will only scan Signatures of programs, which can be modified heavily to avoid detection by cheat coders. One line of code 
can mean detection or not if it comes to the specific signature getting detected. Other anti-cheats such as Battleye, or EAC, scan files 
and programs to ensure a good cheater-free envirement.

[Screen] Untrusted bans

[Voice] Untrusted bans also come up as game bans on somebody's profile. This is caused by the cheat sending invailid packets to
the server, speedhack, worldesp, etc. This usally is an instant ban. People who have an untrusted ban, are probably really not smart, because most cheats have a flag that makes sure people dont get untrusted banned. 

[Screen] Manual Bans

[Voice] This next topic is sort of rocky, because this is a common debate in the modern cheating community. There is really no solid, rock hard evidense that any youtuber, or cheater has been manual banned. If they are real, they are not common at all, and rarely happen. 

[Screen] Community Bans

[Voice] Community bans have nothing to do with CS:GO. A community strike/ban/limitations are given out by steam community moderators. Infractions include, crude name, NSFW profile picture, or name, etc. These bans would only effect your trust factor. Which is a whole nother topic.


Section 2: 

[Screen] The different types of cheaters

[Voice] There are many denominations of cheaters in Counter-Strike. There are 3 main types however. A legit cheater, will not got blatant at all. They will not sacrafice there account in order for them to win. They are extremly 'closet' like in there cheating ways. Most of the time, they are really hard to spot, and normally dont draw attention to themslelves.
